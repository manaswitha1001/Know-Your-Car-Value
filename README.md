# Know-Your-Car-Value

The main aim of this project is to develop a model which predicts the price of the vehicle (cars) price after usage.
Using the power of machine learning algorithms and the attributes of the car our model tries to predict hte market value of the car.

The data is scraped from alll the listings of the site.
We then prerocess the data, clean the data to fit it into our model for furthur predictions.
Since we have the price labels available ,this turns out to be a complete supervised learning challenge.
